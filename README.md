# Fibonacci on Surname & Collatz Conjecture
This file computes the fibonacci on the first and last characters of my lastname, using the ord() built in function of python.


In this exercise, the Collatz Conjecture problem is progrmmed into python by repeatedly applying the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and add 1 if odd) using a while loop and an if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer is printed to the screen. Rather that hard coding the integer value of 17 as requested by the Lecturer, the user is required to supply any valid integer when the algorithm starts.
