# Fibonacci on Surname (fibo2.py)
This file computes the fibonacci on the first and last characters of my lastname, using the ord() built in function of python.

# Collatz Conjecture (colconjecture.py)
In this exercise, the Collatz Conjecture problem is progrmmed into python by repeatedly applying the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and add 1 if odd) using a while loop and an if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer is printed to the screen. Rather that hard coding the integer value of 17 as requested by the Lecturer, the user is required to supply any valid integer when the algorithm starts.

# Smallest Positive Number Evenly Divisible by all of the Numbers from 1 to 20 (leastDiv.py)
The program to find this number will start at 2, iterate to 20, and for each of those numbers it will divide by every 
known prime less than that number (technically any prime less than the square root of the number) to determine their factorization. using the buillt in functions gcd, lcm, we find the numbers that are prime as we go (Mathematically, they are not divisible by any lesser prime, by definition).

# The Iris_flower_data_set program (irisData.py)
This Python script reads in the Iris data set stored in the data subdirectory under the current project and then prints the four numerical petal data values on each row in a nice format on the screen. The printed data are for: Python 3.6 new feature called the f-string is used to print the output here. These are: ### petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. 

# Factorial script (factorial.py)
This Python script contains a function called factorial().It takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120.
