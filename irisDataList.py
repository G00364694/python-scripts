"""
 A Python script that reads in the Iris data set stored in the data subdirectory under
 the current project and then prints the four numerical values on 
 each row in a nice format on the screen. The printed data are for:
 petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. 
 These values are listed with decimal places aligned, and 
 with a space between the columns.
